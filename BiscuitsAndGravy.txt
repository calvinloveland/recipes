~~ Biscuit ~~

2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 Tablespoons butter
3/4 cup buttermilk* (1 Tablespoons vinegar + 3/4 cup milk)
1/4 cup sugar

Preheat oven to 400°
Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. 
Grate the frozen butter into the flour mixture and then use a pastry blender or fork to incorporate it until mixture resembles coarse meal. 
Chill in refrigerator for 10 minutes.
Add buttermilk to flour mixture and stir just until moist.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form gently into a ball.
Roll or pat the dough into a rectangle ½ inch thick.
Fold the dough into thirds (as if folding a piece of paper to fit into an envelope).
Gently re-roll dough into a rectangle, ½ inch thick.
Fold dough into thirds one more time. Gently roll to a 3/4-inch thickness.
Cut dough with a biscuit or cookie cutter to form 10-12 biscuits.
Place them 1 inch apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 
Bake at 400° for 10-12 minutes or until golden and cooked through.
Remove from pan and cool on wire racks.
